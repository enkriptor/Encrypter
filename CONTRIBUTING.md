Hi Everyone!
Contributing to the project is quite simple.
Just create your email ID on www.protonmail.com
With the protonmail email(make sure it's linked with your Github, just for ease!) compose a mail with subject "Contributor" and body as "I'm here to contribute to the Encrypter repository!" along with your Github username or linked email ID.
Within a day or two you'll be added in as a contributor with required guidlines sent to your email to setup the project on your system.
Thank you!
